the following shows a brief explanation of each task, including Functionality, Purpose and Implementation
### Task 1: processArray Function
- **Functionality**: The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as input and processes each number based on its parity (even or odd). It squares even numbers and triples odd numbers.
- **Purpose**: This function provides a way to transform an array of numbers by applying specific mathematical operations to each element, depending on its parity.
- **Implementation**: It iterates through each element of the input array using a loop, checks whether the number is even or odd, and applies the corresponding operation. The results are stored in a new array, which is then returned.

### Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
- **Functionality**: The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers (processed from Task 1). It formats each string based on the corresponding number's parity (even or odd), converting them to uppercase or lowercase accordingly.
- **Purpose**: This function allows for the formatting of strings based on certain conditions, which are determined by the results of processing numbers.
- **Implementation**: It first checks if the lengths of both input arrays are equal to ensure proper correspondence. Then, it iterates through each element of the string array, checking the parity of the corresponding number from the processed numbers array. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, it converts the string to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.

### Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
- **Functionality**: The `createUserProfiles` function generates user profiles based on arrays of original names and modified names. It ensures that both arrays have the same length and creates a user profile object for each pair of names, including an auto-incremented ID.
- **Purpose**: This function facilitates the creation of user profiles with associated data, such as original and modified names, along with unique identifiers.
- **Implementation**: It checks if the lengths of both input arrays are equal. Then, it iterates through each element of the original names array, creating a user profile object for each pair of names. The ID is auto-incremented starting from 1 for each user profile created. Finally, it returns an array containing all user profiles.
